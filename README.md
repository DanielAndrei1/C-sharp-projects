# Elevator-Project-in-Csharp

This application was made in C# .NET and it involves an elevator that moves when a button is clicked.
Elevators are all around us and are very important for our current society after all who would like to take the stairs to the 10th floor, no one, so elevators have been invented when building started to grow taller and taller so that people would move around faster and much more relaxed, hence, the elevator is a means of transport that makes life easier. That is why this project has been born to develop an object-oriented software control application for the two-floor office building of a company, the elevator consists of an elevator car that has inside a control panel with two buttons and a display-window, the elevator has two doors and each floor has two doors, there is one request button on each floor, the elevator has as well voice alerts, as well there is a display-window on each floor. In addition, the elevator has been connected to a database and will show on the screen the information that is present in it.
